# Neural Drummer
General audio work using LSTMs
also imitate analogue effects

input: DWT of drums, corresponding bpm
architecture: convolutional + lstm?
convolutions might be too heavy for real-time use, also might result in frequency inaccuracy because of pooling
but interesting to look at

train lstm

output: drums!
